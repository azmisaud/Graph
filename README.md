## About
This repository is dedicated to solving graph related problems using different algorithms and data structures. Right now, the solution is provided, I will work on detailed explanation of all solution very soon.

## Problems Solved

#### Basic
1. Storing the Graph using Adjacency Matrix - [Solution](./Basic/StoringTheGraph1.java)
2. Storing the Graph using Adjacency List - [Solution](./Basic/StoringTheGraph2.java)
3. Storing the Directed Graph - [Solution](./Basic/StoringTheDirectedGraph.java)
4. Storing the Weighted Graph - [Solution](./Basic/StoringTheWeightedGraph.java)


#### Easy

1. [BFS of Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/bfs-traversal-of-graph/1) - [Solution](./Easy/BFSofGraph.java)
2. [DFS of Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/depth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/1) - [Solution](./Easy/DFSofGraph.java)
